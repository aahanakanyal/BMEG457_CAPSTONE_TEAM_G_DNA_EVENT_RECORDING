# BMEG457_CAPSTONE_TEAM_G_DNA_EVENT_RECORDING

Repository for simulations used to generate graphs for TEAM G - DNA EVENT RECORDING 

Video simulation for ideal cell division conditions as outlined in DHF 8 (Condition 1): Please run the file *idealcondsim.m* to view MATLAB Movie

Video simulation for literature based cell division conditions as outlined in DHF 8 (Condition 2): Please run the file *litbasedsim.m* to view MATLAB Movie

Fluorescence Plots for Conditions 1 and 2 can be generated by running the file *FluorescencePlots.m*

-----The code in this reporsitory is still rather preliminary and needs to be updated based on additionally experimental data-----
