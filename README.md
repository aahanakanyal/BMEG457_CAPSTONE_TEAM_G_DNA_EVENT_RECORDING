# BMEG457_CAPSTONE_TEAM_G_DNA_EVENT_RECORDING

Repository for simulations used to generate graphs for TEAM G - DNA EVENT RECORDING 

Video simulation for cell division conditions as outlined in the final report: Please run the file *SIM_GRIDCELLDIV_WITHPROB_FINAL.m* to view MATLAB Movie

The initial iterations of the model can be found in the files: *FluorescencePlots.m* , *idealcondsim.m* and *litbasedsim.m*
    

-----The code in this reporsitory is still rather preliminary and needs to be updated based on additionally experimental data-----
